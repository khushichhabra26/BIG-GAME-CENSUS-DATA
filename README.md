# BIG-GAME-CENSUS-DATA


**Project Overview** -

This project aims to analyze census data and player information to identify patterns and insights about population estimates and their possible impact on player distribution and team compositions.


**Objective** -

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create data visualizations that uncover trends in population demographics and their relationship with player data. Tools used include Excel and Power BI for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.


**Datasets** -

Data collected from population census estimates and player data.

**Key columns**: GEOID,Name, Population Estimate, Player Birthplace and state, Age, Weight, Team, and Conference.


**Key Sections** -

**Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and validated data using Excel, removing duplicates, correcting errors, and filtering unnecessary columns.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA**): Used Excel pivot tables and charts to explore and analyze player and population data.

**Data Visualization**: Created interactive visualizations and dashboards using Power BI to uncover key population trends and player distributions.


**Files Included** -

**Big_Game_Census_Presentation.pptx**- PowerPoint slides for the project.

**Big_Game_Visualizations.pdf**- Power BI report file.

**Big_Game_Cleaned_Data.xlsx** - Cleaned dataset used for analysis.

**README.md**- Project overview and instructions.


**How to Run the Project** -

Download or clone the repository.

Open **Big_Game_Cleaned_Data.xlsx**to explore the cleaned dataset.

Open **Big_Game_Visualizations.pdf** in Power BI to interact with the visualizations.

Check the PowerPoint file for key insights and presentation format.


**Conclusion** -

This project offers insights into how population estimates and player data correlate, highlighting potential trends in player distribution based on geographic regions.
